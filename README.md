# Customer Feedback Sentiment Analysis (ML + Flask) üß†

A simple yet powerful sentiment analysis system that predicts whether customer feedback is **Positive** or **Negative** with a confidence percentage using **python** and **natural language processing (NLP) techniques**, this project enables businesses to gain insights into customer opinions, improving decision-making and customer experience.

## Features

- **Sentiment Classification**: Accurately categorizes customer feedback into positive or negative sentiments.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and processes feedback data with tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization.
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly interface for inputting feedback and viewing sentiment results.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for data processing and machine learning.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **NLTK**: For NLP tasks like sentiment analysis and text preprocessing.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Flask, HTML5, & Bootstrap 5**: For deploying the model as a web application.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For exploratory data analysis and model development.
